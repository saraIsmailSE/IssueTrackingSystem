# IssueTrackingSystem
 This is a simple Issue Tracking System devloped in php. the system make the user able to create a task and assign it to someone of developers.The user can resolve the task,reopen it, close it, in these 3 status there is an email will sent to the QA’s/PM’s notify them that the task status has been changed. There is 2 button will appear first (resolve/close) the reopen will appear if the user resolve the task or close it, if the task is closed no resolve or close button should appear, only the reopen will shown, if the task is resolved the close and reopen button should appear.  Also, we have an admin panel allow the admin to add/delete/edit the users, and give them the ROLE with generated password and username.  Also any user should be able to edit the task (change it’s info), but only the owner/creator of task OR Admin can delete the task.  This project prepared by: Yasser Shawish
